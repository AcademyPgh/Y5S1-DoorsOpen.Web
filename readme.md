# Doors Open - Web
Doors Open Pgh wanted a way to replace printed event materials. Half of the team created an ASP.NET Core MVC back-end, using Azure image hosting, for an easy-to-use interface for staff to add, update, and delete their event listing information. It was then connected to a front-end React Native mobile app, built by the other half of the team, for event attendees to utilize.
